He would reprise the role in Hannibal in 2001 and in a second adaptation of Red Dragon made in 2002 under the original title. The NBC television series Hannibal debuted in 2013, and focuses on the development of the relationship between Lecter and Will Graham, an FBI profiler. In the series, Lecter is portrayed by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen, who won a Saturn Award for his performance.
